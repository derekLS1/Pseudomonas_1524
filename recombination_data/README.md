# Recombination data used in paper

All files titled with clonalframe are the output from clonalframe

concat_107.fasta: Concatenated core for 107 isolates of OTU5 on which clonalframe was run

concat_197.nwk: ML tree built from full comparison across Pseudmonas 1821 strains but then limited to 107 strains. Note: this tree is based off of only SNP sites so branch lengths are not scaled.
